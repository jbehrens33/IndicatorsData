# IndicatorsData

The following repository is a temporary storage location for the supplemental tables submitted for review for the manuscript titled "Integrating Contaminant Source Indicators, Water Quality Measures, and Ecotoxicity to Characterize Contaminant Mixtures and Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Variability in an Urban Watershed" submitted to ES&T on April 23, 2025.

We intend to work with the editors, prior to publication, to ensure the data is easily accessible and readable in a permanent location (e.g., as SI materials attached to the publication or submitted to an online public repository).
